## CRITICAL BUGS & ISSUES REQUIRING FIXES üö®

### **1. DATA FLOW/CONTEXT PROPAGATION BUG (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
- **Issue**: AI summaries and insights do not reflect actual participant dialogue
- **Symptoms**: AI fabricates participants (e.g., "Michael", "Sarah", "Jamal") and generates verbose, generic content even when given minimal or specific input
- **Impact**: Core functionality broken - AI not using real session transcript data
- **Evidence**: Despite prompt fixes to prevent hallucination, production testing shows AI still not grounded in actual responses
- **Location**: Likely in data flow between frontend (`RoundtableCanvas.tsx`) and backend API routes
- **Debug Status**: Server-side debug logging deployed to `/api/analyze` but needs analysis

### **2. COLLAPSIBLE INSTRUCTIONS BUG**
- **Issue**: Both facilitator instructions and notes accordions in RoundtableCanvas.tsx
- **Symptoms**: Both accordions scroll/unscroll but only one populates content correctly
- **Requirement**: Either open/close independently OR jointly, but both must populate content
- **Location**: `src/components/RoundtableCanvas.tsx` accordion UI components

### **3. PDF EXPORT LIMITATION**
- **Current**: HTML blob download using browser print dialog
- **Required**: Real, shareable PDF generation using library like jsPDF
- **Attempts**: Previous implementation attempts caused JSX syntax errors and deployment failures
- **Approach**: Must implement incrementally and test thoroughly to avoid breaking builds

### **4. CONVERSATION CAPTURE WORKFLOW**
- **Current**: Manual name/comment capture for each participant response
- **Required**: Automatic transcript capture reflecting natural roundtable flow
- **Vision**: Live discussion transcript input with quick add comment section and speech-to-text integration
- **Dependencies**: Must chain section summaries and insights to feed context into subsequent sections

### **5. SPEED OPTIMIZATION**
- **Issue**: Summary generation and insights are slow for longer transcripts
- **Impact**: Poor user experience during facilitation
- **Requirement**: Optimize for speed and efficiency, potentially with incremental processing
