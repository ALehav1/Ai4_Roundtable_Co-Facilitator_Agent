# Testing Baseline - Pre-Cleanup State
**Date**: 2025-08-07T12:13:33-04:00
**Branch**: pre-cleanup-backup
**Dev Server**: ✅ Running successfully on http://localhost:3002

## Current Functionality Working
- [x] Dev server starts without errors
- [x] Next.js 15.4.5 build system operational
- [x] Environment variables loading (.env.local)
- [x] Port conflict handling (auto-switched to 3002)

## Components to Test After Cleanup
- [ ] Can start recording
- [ ] Can add manual entry  
- [ ] Can see AI insights
- [ ] Can export PDF
- [ ] Session saves to localStorage
- [ ] Facilitator panel works
- [ ] Template system works

## Files Planned for Removal
- src/components/RoundtableCanvas.tsx (obsolete - using V2)
- src/components/SessionSummary.tsx (integrated into V2)
- src/__tests__/ directory (unused test files)
- babel.config.js, jest.config.js, jest.setup.js (test configs)

## Safety Protocol
- Backup branch: pre-cleanup-backup ✅ 
- Working branch: feature/cleanup-and-smart-detection ✅
- Can rollback with: `git reset --hard HEAD~1` or `git checkout pre-cleanup-backup`
